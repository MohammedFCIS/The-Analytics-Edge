baseball <- read.csv("data/baseball.csv")
glimpse(baseball)
```


## Subset to only include moneyball years
```{r}
moneyball <- subset(baseball, Year < 2002)

## Compute Run Difference
```{r}
moneyball$RD <- moneyball$RS - moneyball$RA
glimpse(moneyball)
```

## Scatterplot to check for linear relationship
```{r}
plot(moneyball$RD, moneyball$W)
```

# Regression model to predict wins
```{r}
WinsReg = lm(W ~ RD, data=moneyball)
summary(WinsReg)
```

# Regression model to predict runs scored
```{r}
RunsReg = lm(RS ~ OBP + SLG + BA, data=moneyball)
summary(RunsReg)

RunsReg = lm(RS ~ OBP + SLG, data=moneyball)
